To whom it may concern, 

This letter is in support of Kyle Butler maintaining contact with his children.

I am a high school teacher at Taos High School and college professor at University of New Mexico.

I first met Kyle, Paige, and Liam at the onset of the Taos Launchpad, then continued to visit with them occasionally during the rest of their time in Taos. I would estimate 8 in-person visits total.

During that time Kyle expressed a consistently caring and compassionate attitude and a calm loving demeanor toward his son Liam.

Please feel free to contact me if more information is needed.

Sincerely, 
Andrew Whitedove
