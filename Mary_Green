From: Mary Green 
Subject: recommendation of Kyle's parenting

I've seen Kyle here in Taos many times, with his family and he is always present and grounded and communicative with his son, Liam.  They are cleared bonded to one another and have an easy going (but nicely boundaried) and loving relationship.

And I have seen Kyle with other children in the community... showing them around the community workshop that he helped create...and he was the same with them as he is with Liam.  He's considerate, has good boundaries and is effective in communicating with them.

I am a massage therapist and a mother (and so I have some training in a professional's point of view in assessing human behavior).  I would be happy to communicate with you further if need be, and am available at this email addy or at 575-224-0852.

Sincerely,
Mary Green LMT NM #3413
