My name is Gareth Pritchard. I am writing this character reference on behalf of my friend Kyle Butler. Through the years that I've known Kyle, I have observed him to be nothing more than an outstanding, upright person in all aspects of his life. As a father, Kyle goes to great lengths to provide for, and educate his son (Liam). I've never seen a father spend more time with his child, imparting upon him the most important lessons in life, like that of respect, manners, and hard work. Never once have i felt or witnessed any kind of neglect of Liam. No matter what Kyle has always kept a roof over his families head, their bellies full, and their health in good standing (especially as a trained  EMT) and has never had a problem doing so. Just like any other child with great parents, Liam has his own room with toys, books and etc. I have also observed Kyle to be an extremely compassionate boyfriend to his girlfriend and baby's mother Paige. From what i have seen, and know to be true Kyle loves and cares for her deeply. Anytime she fell ill, Kyle would lovingly nurse her back to health, and take care of Liam while she recovered. He really seems to put her needs before his own, and as any decent man with a family desires, is to provide and care for them as best they can, and that is exactly what Kyle does. He is truly a good father, and partner.
