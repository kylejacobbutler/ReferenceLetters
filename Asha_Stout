To whom it may concern;

My name is Asha Stout. I have been a firefighter and public school teacher in Taos County, New Mexico for most of the last decade.

I came to know and appreciate Kyle Butler and his family when his son Liam was a very young toddler. They had created a nurturing home in a converted school bus RV and were attending to Liam's education and growth via homeschooling and positive examples.  

Over the course of many years i came to appreciate the kind and gentle nature I saw growing in Liam. No doubt he was learning from kyle's loving example. 

It has come to my attention that Kyle has lost contact with his son Liam. 

As a new father myself this news saddens me greatly. 

If a court or custodian has ruled that Kyle is unfit to father Liam, i find it hard to believe that that court knew the depth of Kyle's love for his son, or the quality of Kyle's character.

Kyle Butler is one of the most genuine and intelligent people i have met in my decade in New Mexico. While his livelihood and choice of homesteads has always been creative and unique; if America is still the land of the free, then i believe that these lifestyle choices have little bearing in a custody decision. Instead i believe his love and gentle care for his family should be the measure of Kyle's ability to maintain custody of his son. 

As we face a new decade of unprecedented change, i assert that intelligent people who care deeply for their families and for the earth, deserves as much chance to grown with their families as those who choose to live consumptive lifestyles from the suburbs. In fact, their with new and different ways of seeing the world and the new and different solutions they may present, such families may be our only hope in a rapidly changing world. 

If i can be of service as you deliberate the case before you, please do not hesitate to contact me. 

Sincerely, 
Asha A. Stout
