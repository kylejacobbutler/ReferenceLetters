To whom it may concern regarding Kyle's relationship with Liam. My name is Angela Herrera and the Butlers have been neighbors of mine a couple of years ago, I have stayed friends with them ever since. 

Kyle is one of the most intelligent individuals I have met and his ability to build, design, and create music is necessary in this world. And always there by his side, is Liam, building, and working together. As I have seen Liam grow from a toddler into a boy, I am impressed with his dexterity, skills, and articulation. I have more intelligent, fun, and even deeper conversations with him than most adults. Even his problem solving and conflict resolving is better developed than the average college student, thanks to Kyle and Paige's patience and calm tones -even in the throws of the short-lived terrible 2's tantrums. I remember very well, them getting on his level, "Hey buddy, we want to help you, but if we don't know what you need, we can't. Can you help me understand you by calming down and talking to me in a nice way?" 

Liam is smart, fun and interacts with others (of all ages) exceptionally well. I have had the joy of getting to take Liam out with me and my parents. My mom used to be a teacher, and is currently a doctor that deals with families and she always has something to say about everything. One of her comments of Liam "his parents done good." My dad, "he's got his dad's engineering mind." 

I love Liam very much. He's made a permanent impression on me. Both of his parents have already given him a major leg up in the world and I look forward to seeing the man he becomes with the shaping of both of his parents.
